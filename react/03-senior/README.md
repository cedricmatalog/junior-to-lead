# Level 3: Senior Developer

**Focus**: Expertise
**Goal**: Make architectural decisions, ensure quality at scale, and mentor others.

## Milestone

You've completed this level when you can:
- Design systems that scale with team and product growth
- Set technical direction for a feature area or product
- Mentor junior and mid-level developers effectively
- Balance technical excellence with business constraints
- Lead code reviews that teach and improve team standards

## Recommended Path

1. **Architecture Patterns** and **ADRs** make decisions durable
2. **System Design** expands your platform thinking
3. **Advanced Performance** and **Performance Budgets** prevent regressions
4. **Security Practices** and **Supply-Chain Security** protect the stack
5. **Accessibility** ensures inclusive defaults at scale
6. **Design Systems** and **Design Handoff** keep UI aligned
7. **Observability** and **Production Triage** reduce incident impact
8. **Code Review** and **Mentoring** multiply your effectiveness
9. **Next.js Advanced** and **App Router Deep Dive** strengthen framework mastery
10. **Framework Comparison** broadens your architectural choices
11. **Modern React APIs** and **Web Workers** protect performance and concurrency
12. **Privacy** and **Subresource Integrity** harden user trust and vendor safety

## Key Transitions at This Level

- From individual contributor to force multiplier
- From solving problems to preventing problems
- From learning to teaching
- From following standards to setting standards
- From feature work to platform thinking

## Leadership vs Management

At this level, you're developing **technical leadership** skills - influencing through expertise, not authority. This prepares you for the Lead level, where leadership becomes central.

## Next Level

Once you've hit the milestone, proceed to [Lead Developer](../04-lead/).
