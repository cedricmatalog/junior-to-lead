## Recommended Path

1. **Architecture** and **System Design** shape your technical thinking
2. **Performance**, **Security**, and **Accessibility** ensure production quality
3. **Design Systems** and **Observability** scale your impact
4. **Code Review** and **Mentoring** multiply your effectiveness
5. **Next.js Advanced** and **Frameworks** broaden your expertise

## Key Transitions at This Level

- From individual contributor to force multiplier
- From solving problems to preventing problems
- From learning to teaching
- From following standards to setting standards
- From feature work to platform thinking

## Leadership vs Management

At this level, you're developing **technical leadership** skills - influencing through expertise, not authority. This prepares you for the Lead level, where leadership becomes central.

## Next Level

Once you've hit the milestone, proceed to [Lead Developer](../04-lead/).
