# Level 1: Junior Developer

**Focus**: Foundation
**Goal**: Solidify React fundamentals and professional development practices.

## Milestone

You've completed this level when you can:
- Independently build and ship features with clean, tested code
- Write components that are readable and maintainable
- Debug issues effectively using browser tools
- Collaborate with your team through proper git workflows

## Recommended Path

1. Start with **React Fundamentals** if you need to solidify basics
2. Move through **Component Patterns** and **Hooks** - these are your daily tools
3. **State Management** gives you control over shared UI behavior
4. **Routing** gives you real URLs with SPA navigation
5. **Forms** cover most real-world input challenges
6. **Styling** and **Responsive Layouts** make the UI work everywhere
7. **Tooling** keeps your project buildable and shareable
8. **Testing** and **Debugging** make you self-sufficient
9. **Accessibility** ensures your UI works for everyone
10. **Git Workflows** prepares you for team collaboration

## Time Investment

Work through each module at your own pace. Most developers spend 2-4 weeks per module when applying concepts to real projects.

## Next Level

Once you've hit the milestone, proceed to [Mid-Level Developer](../02-mid-level/).
