# Level 1: Junior Developer

**Focus**: Foundation
**Goal**: Solidify React fundamentals and professional development practices.

## Milestone

You've completed this level when you can:
- Independently build and ship features with clean, tested code
- Write components that are readable and maintainable
- Debug issues effectively using browser tools
- Collaborate with your team through proper git workflows

## Modules

| # | Module | Key Topics |
|---|--------|------------|
| 1 | [React Fundamentals](01-react-fundamentals.md) | JSX, components, props, conditional rendering, lists |
| 2 | [Component Patterns](02-component-patterns.md) | Composition, children, compound components, controlled vs uncontrolled |
| 3 | [Hooks Deep Dive](03-hooks-deep-dive.md) | useState, useEffect, useRef, useContext, custom hooks, rules of hooks |
| 4 | [State Management Basics](04-state-management-basics.md) | Local state, lifting state, Context API, when to use Redux/Zustand |
| 5 | [Forms & Validation](05-forms-and-validation.md) | React Hook Form, Formik, Zod/Yup, controlled inputs, error display |
| 6 | [Styling Approaches](06-styling-approaches.md) | CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS, styled-components, design tokens |
| 7 | [Testing Fundamentals](07-testing-fundamentals.md) | Jest basics, React Testing Library, unit tests, test structure |
| 8 | [Debugging Techniques](08-debugging-techniques.md) | React DevTools, console methods, breakpoints, error boundaries |
| 9 | [Git Workflows](09-git-workflows.md) | Branching strategies, PR etiquette, meaningful commits, conflict resolution |
| 10 | [Accessibility Fundamentals](10-accessibility-fundamentals.md) | WCAG, semantic HTML, ARIA, keyboard/focus |

## Recommended Path

1. Start with **React Fundamentals** if you need to solidify basics
2. Move through **Component Patterns** and **Hooks** - these are your daily tools
3. **State Management** and **Forms** cover most real-world UI challenges
4. **Styling** ensures you can make things look professional
5. **Testing** and **Debugging** make you self-sufficient
6. **Accessibility** ensures your UI works for everyone
7. **Git Workflows** prepares you for team collaboration

## Time Investment

Work through each module at your own pace. Most developers spend 2-4 weeks per module when applying concepts to real projects.

## Next Level

Once you've hit the milestone, proceed to [Mid-Level Developer](../02-mid-level/).
