# Level 2: Mid-Level Developer

**Focus**: Proficiency
**Goal**: Handle complex features, optimize performance, and write production-grade code.

## Milestone

You've completed this level when you can:
- Own complex features end-to-end with minimal guidance
- Make informed decisions about state management and architecture
- Write comprehensive tests that catch real bugs
- Optimize performance before it becomes a problem
- Work effectively with TypeScript in a large codebase

## Modules

| # | Module | Key Topics |
|---|--------|------------|
| 1 | [Advanced Patterns](01-advanced-patterns.md) | HOCs, render props, compound components, headless UI, polymorphic components |
| 2 | [Performance Optimization](02-performance-optimization.md) | React.memo, useMemo, useCallback, virtualization, bundle analysis, lazy loading |
| 3 | [State at Scale](03-state-at-scale.md) | Redux Toolkit, Zustand, Jotai, server state (TanStack Query), state machines |
| 4 | [API Design & Integration](04-api-design-integration.md) | REST patterns, GraphQL basics, error handling, optimistic updates, caching |
| 5 | [Error Handling Patterns](05-error-handling-patterns.md) | Error boundaries, try/catch strategies, user-friendly errors, fallback UI |
| 6 | [Internationalization](06-internationalization.md) | react-i18next, locale detection, RTL support, pluralization, date/number formats |
| 7 | [Testing Strategies](07-testing-strategies.md) | Integration tests, mocking strategies, test coverage, CI/CD testing |
| 8 | [TypeScript Mastery](08-typescript-mastery.md) | Generics, utility types, discriminated unions, strict mode, type guards |
| 9 | [Code Quality](09-code-quality.md) | ESLint rules, Prettier, code organization, documentation, refactoring |
| 10 | [Next.js Fundamentals](10-nextjs-fundamentals.md) | Pages vs App Router, SSR/SSG basics, API routes, file-based routing |

## Recommended Path

1. **Advanced Patterns** expands your component toolkit
2. **Performance** and **State at Scale** handle growing complexity
3. **API Design** and **Error Handling** make your apps robust
4. **Internationalization** prepares you for global users
5. **Testing** and **TypeScript** ensure code quality
6. **Code Quality** and **Next.js** round out production skills

## Key Transitions at This Level

- From "making it work" to "making it right"
- From following patterns to choosing patterns
- From fixing bugs to preventing bugs
- From individual code to team-scalable code

## Next Level

Once you've hit the milestone, proceed to [Senior Developer](../03-senior/).
