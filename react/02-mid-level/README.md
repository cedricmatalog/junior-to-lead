# Level 2: Mid-Level Developer

**Focus**: Proficiency
**Goal**: Handle complex features, optimize performance, and write production-grade code.

## Milestone

You've completed this level when you can:
- Own complex features end-to-end with minimal guidance
- Make informed decisions about state management and architecture
- Write comprehensive tests that catch real bugs
- Optimize performance before it becomes a problem
- Work effectively with TypeScript in a large codebase

## Recommended Path

1. **Advanced Patterns** expands your component toolkit
2. **Performance** and **State at Scale** handle growing complexity
3. **State Tool Selection** keeps boundaries healthy
4. **API Design** and **Error Handling** make your apps robust
5. **Internationalization** prepares you for global users
6. **Testing Strategies** and **Accessibility Testing** build confidence and coverage
7. **TypeScript** sharpens correctness and refactors
8. **Code Quality** and **Next.js** round out production skills
9. **E2E Testing** protects critical user journeys
10. **Animations** add clarity and polish to UI changes
11. **Deployment** makes releases reliable

## Key Transitions at This Level

- From "making it work" to "making it right"
- From following patterns to choosing patterns
- From fixing bugs to preventing bugs
- From individual code to team-scalable code

## Next Level

Once you've hit the milestone, proceed to [Senior Developer](../03-senior/).
