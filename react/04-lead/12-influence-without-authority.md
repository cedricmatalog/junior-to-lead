## Building Credibility

### Credibility Equation

```
Credibility = (Competence + Reliability + Intimacy) / Self-Interest
```

**Competence**: Do you know what you're talking about?
**Reliability**: Do you do what you say?
**Intimacy**: Do people feel safe with you?
**Self-Interest**: Are you in it for you or the team?

## Persuasion Techniques

### The Art of Persuasion

```markdown
## Persuasion Framework

### 1. Understand Their Position
Before trying to convince, truly understand.
- What do they believe?
- Why do they believe it?
- What are their concerns?
- What would change their mind?

### 2. Find Common Ground
Start from agreement, not disagreement.
"We both want this project to succeed..."

### 3. Present Evidence
- Data over opinions
- Examples from experience
- External case studies
- Logical reasoning

### 4. Address Concerns
Don't ignore objections, address them.
"I know you're worried about X. Here's how we handle that..."

### 5. Make It Easy
- Reduce perceived risk
- Offer to take on work
- Propose small first steps
- Provide escape hatches
```

### Data-Driven Persuasion

```markdown
## Using Data Effectively

### Gathering Data
- Measure current state
- Find industry benchmarks
- Run experiments
- Document outcomes

### Presenting Data
- Lead with the insight, not the data
- Visualize for impact
- Compare to something familiar
- Acknowledge limitations

### Example
Instead of:
"Bundle size is 2.3MB"

Say:
"Our bundle is 2.3MB - 3x larger than similar sites.
This adds 4 seconds to load time on average connections,
which studies show causes 40% of users to leave.
Reducing by half could recover $X in conversions."
```

### Storytelling

```markdown
## Persuasion Through Story

### Story Structure
1. **Context**: Set the scene
2. **Challenge**: What's the problem?
3. **Journey**: What did we try?
4. **Resolution**: What worked?
5. **Lesson**: What should we learn?

### Example
"Last year, we faced constant production issues.
Every week something broke. Team morale was low.

We decided to invest in testing. It was hard -
slowed us down initially. People pushed back.

But after three months, incidents dropped 80%.
The team is happier. We ship faster because we're
confident.

This same investment in monitoring would have
similar impact on our current debugging time."
```

## Building Consensus

### Consensus Process

```markdown
## Getting to Agreement

### Pre-Meeting
- Identify stakeholders
- Have 1:1 conversations first
- Understand positions
- Find potential allies

### During Discussion
- Let everyone speak
- Acknowledge all perspectives
- Find common ground
- Identify true blockers vs preferences

### Reaching Decision
- Summarize the options
- State the recommendation
- Ask for objections
- Confirm commitment

### Post-Decision
- Document the decision
- Communicate to affected parties
- Follow up on commitments
- Revisit if circumstances change
```

### Navigating Resistance

```markdown
## Types of Resistance

### The Skeptic
"That won't work here."
→ Show relevant examples, offer to prove it

### The Traditionalist
"We've always done it this way."
→ Acknowledge what works, show evolution not revolution

### The Blocker
"I don't have bandwidth for this."
→ Reduce their burden, do more of the work

### The Politics Player
"This threatens my team's ownership."
→ Find ways to share credit, align incentives
```
