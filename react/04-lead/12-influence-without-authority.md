# Influence Without Authority

> **Last reviewed**: 2026-01-06


## Week 43: The Soft Power Test

A cross-team decision is stuck, and you do not have formal authority to resolve it. Sarah asks you to move it forward through influence, not escalation. Marcus reminds you that credibility and relationships are your strongest tools. This week focuses on building trust, persuading with data and stories, building consensus, and leading by example.

## Mental Models

Before you dive in, here's how to think about the core concepts:

| Concept | Think of it as... |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Influence** | A lever - small inputs can move big decisions |
| **Credibility** | A reputation ledger - deposits and withdrawals over time |
| **Persuasion** | A story arc - connect problem, journey, and outcome |
| **Consensus** | A coalition - align enough people to move forward |

Keep these in mind. They'll click as you build.

## Chapter 1: Understand Sources of Influence

Sarah points out that you do not need a title to lead. Influence comes from how people experience working with you.

```markdown
## Sources of Influence

- Expertise: You solve hard problems
- Relationships: You show up and help
- Communication: You explain and listen
- Character: You are consistent and fair
```

## Chapter 2: Build Credibility

Marcus uses the credibility equation to show what you can control.

```
Credibility = (Competence + Reliability + Intimacy) / Self-Interest
```

```markdown
## Build Credibility

Competence:
- Research before speaking
- Admit what you do not know
- Share learning openly

Reliability:
- Do what you say you will do
- Communicate early if plans change

Intimacy:
- Create safety in conversations
- Protect confidential details
```

## Chapter 3: Persuade with Data and Story

Sarah wants every argument to connect evidence to impact, then land with a story that people remember.

```markdown
## Persuasion Framework

1. Understand their position and concerns
2. Find common ground
3. Present evidence
4. Address objections directly
5. Offer a safe first step
```

```markdown
## Data-Driven Example

Instead of:
"Bundle size is 2.3MB"

Say:
"Our bundle is 2.3MB, about 3x larger than similar sites.
This adds 4 seconds on average connections, which reduces
conversion. Cutting it in half could recover $X per month."
```

## Chapter 4: Build Consensus

Marcus recommends pre-wiring: talk to stakeholders before the big meeting.

```markdown
## Consensus Process

Pre-meeting:
- Identify stakeholders
- Run 1:1 conversations
- Understand concerns

During the meeting:
- Let everyone speak
- Summarize points of agreement
- Ask for remaining objections

After:
- Document the decision
- Assign owners
- Follow up on commitments
```

## Chapter 5: Navigate Resistance

Sarah suggests naming the resistance type so you can respond without defensiveness.

```markdown
## Types of Resistance

Skeptic: "That will not work here"
- Response: Show relevant examples and propose a small test

Traditionalist: "We have always done it this way"
- Response: Preserve what works, change what does not

Blocker: "I do not have bandwidth"
- Response: Reduce their burden or take on work
```

## Chapter 6: Lead by Example

Marcus reminds you that culture changes when people see the behavior, not when they hear a speech.

```markdown
## Lead by Example

- Write high-quality PRs and tests
- Document decisions as you make them
- Share credit publicly
- Stay calm during incidents
```

## Common Mistakes

1. **Relying on title** - Influence fails when authority is missing.
2. **Pushing without listening** - People resist when they feel unheard.
3. **Over-arguing** - Too much logic without empathy stalls progress.
4. **Ignoring incentives** - Decisions follow incentives, not just reasons.

## Practice Exercises

1. Map your influence network and identify gaps
2. Prepare a persuasive case for a change you want
3. Design a consensus plan for a cross-team decision
