# Conflict Resolution

Navigate disagreements productively and strengthen relationships.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Recognize and address conflicts early

## Types of Conflict

### Common Engineering Conflicts

```markdown
## Conflict Categories

### Technical Disagreements
- Architecture approach A vs B
- Technology choice debates
- Code style preferences
- Testing strategies

### Process Disagreements
- How to run sprints
- Code review standards
- Documentation requirements
- Meeting frequency

### Interpersonal Issues
- Communication style clashes
- Perceived disrespect
- Workload fairness
- Recognition and credit

### Priority Conflicts
- Feature vs tech debt
- Scope vs timeline
- Quality vs speed
```

## Early Warning Signs

```markdown
## Recognizing Conflict Early

### In Meetings
- People talking over each other
- Eye rolls or dismissive body language
- Silent disengagement
- Same arguments repeated

### In Code Review
- Increasingly terse comments
- Rejected PRs without explanation
- Personal attacks disguised as feedback
- Approval without engagement

### In Chat
- Passive-aggressive messages
- Publicly calling out individuals
- Silence on normally active topics
- Side conversations forming

### In 1:1s
- Complaining about specific people
- "They always..." statements
- Unwillingness to compromise
- Asking you to take sides
```

## Mediation Approach

### The Mediation Process

```markdown
## Conflict Resolution Steps

### 1. Separate Conversations
Meet with each person individually first.

"I've noticed some tension around X.
I'd like to understand your perspective."

- Let them vent
- Don't take sides
- Understand their position
- Identify their core needs

### 2. Identify Common Ground
What do both parties actually agree on?

- Both want project to succeed
- Both want respectful environment
- Both have valid concerns

### 3. Joint Conversation
Bring them together with structure.

"I've spoken with both of you. I think there's
more common ground than either realized.
Let's work through this together."

### 4. Focus on Interests, Not Positions
Position: "We must use Redux"
Interest: "I need predictable state management"

Position: "Redux is overbearing"
Interest: "I want simpler code"

### 5. Generate Options
"What are all the possible solutions?"
- Brainstorm without judgment
- Look for creative options
- Consider hybrid approaches

### 6. Agree on Next Steps
"Here's what we've decided.
Let's check in next week to see how it's going."
```

### Technical Disagreement Resolution

```markdown
## Framework for Technical Decisions

### Step 1: Define the Problem
"What are we actually trying to solve?"
Get agreement on the problem before solutions.

### Step 2: Define Criteria
"What does a good solution look like?"
- Performance requirements
- Maintainability needs
- Team expertise
- Timeline constraints

### Step 3: Evaluate Options
"How does each option meet our criteria?"
Use objective evaluation, not preferences.

| Criterion | Option A | Option B |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Performance | Good | Better |
| Complexity | Simple | Complex |
| Team Experience | High | Low |

### Step 4: Make a Decision
"Based on our criteria, Option A best fits our needs
because..."

### Step 5: Commit
"We've decided. Now we all support this direction."
```

## De-escalation Techniques

### In the Moment

```markdown
## De-escalation Tactics

### Take a Break
"This is a good discussion. Let's take 10 minutes
and come back with fresh perspective."

### Acknowledge Emotions
"I can see you feel strongly about this.
Help me understand why this matters so much to you."

### Reframe the Conflict
From: "You vs. Me"
To: "Us vs. The Problem"

"We both want the best solution.
Let's figure this out together."

### Slow Down
- Lower your voice
- Speak more slowly
- Allow pauses
- Ask clarifying questions

### Summarize Understanding
"Let me make sure I understand your position..."
Often people escalate because they don't feel heard.
```

### When You're Involved

```markdown
## When You're Part of the Conflict

### Check Yourself
- Am I being defensive?
- Am I truly listening?
- What's my contribution to this?
- What do I actually need?

### Seek to Understand
"Help me see this from your perspective."
Genuinely try to understand, not just wait to respond.

### Own Your Part
"You're right, I did X, and that wasn't helpful."
Admitting fault often de-escalates quickly.

### Express Needs Clearly
"What I need is Y. Can we find a way to get there?"
```

## Finding Solutions

### Win-Win Thinking

```markdown
## Moving Beyond Zero-Sum

### Zero-Sum Thinking
"If we use Redux, I lose."
"If we don't use Redux, you lose."

### Win-Win Thinking
"What solution gives us both what we need?"
- Predictable state management (their need)
- Simple code (your need)
- Maybe: Zustand (simpler than Redux, still predictable)

### Expanding the Pie
- Can we do both at different times?
- Can we experiment and decide later?
- Can we split the work differently?
- What constraints can we remove?
```

### Disagree and Commit

```markdown
## When Agreement Isn't Possible

Sometimes reasonable people disagree.
The process for unresolved conflicts:

1. **Discuss thoroughly**: All perspectives heard
2. **Decide**: Someone makes the call
3. **Commit**: Everyone supports the decision
4. **Evaluate**: Revisit after results

Example:
"We've debated this thoroughly. I've decided we'll use
Approach A because [reasons]. I know you preferred B,
and your concerns are valid. Can I count on your full
support as we move forward?"
```

## Preventing Conflict

```markdown
## Building a Low-Conflict Environment

### Clear Expectations
- Document standards
- Make decisions explicit
- Define roles clearly

### Psychological Safety
- Model vulnerability
- Celebrate questions
- Allow failure

### Regular Communication
- Don't let issues fester
- Weekly syncs
- Open door policy

### Respect Differences
- Different working styles okay
- Value diverse perspectives
- Assume good intent
```

## Practice Exercises

1. Role-play mediating a technical disagreement
2. Practice de-escalation in a heated discussion
3. Create a framework for technical decisions on your team
