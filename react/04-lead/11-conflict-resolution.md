# Conflict Resolution

> **Last reviewed**: 2026-01-06


## Week 42: The Heated Debate

Two senior engineers are locked in a technical disagreement, and the tension is spreading. Sarah asks you to mediate before the conflict hardens into factions. Marcus reminds you that conflict is normal, but unmanaged conflict drains trust and velocity. This week focuses on early signals, mediation steps, de-escalation, and decision frameworks that move teams forward.

## Mental Models

Before we dive in, here's how to think about the core concepts:

| Concept | Think of it as... |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Conflict** | A pressure valve - release it before it bursts |
| **Mediation** | A bridge - connect two sides safely |
| **Interests vs positions** | An iceberg - real needs sit below the surface |
| **Decision frameworks** | A referee - enforce fair rules |

Keep these in mind. They'll click as we build.

## Prerequisites

Module 41 (Effective 1:1s) - Comfort giving feedback and holding tough conversations.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- [ ] Recognize conflict early and intervene calmly
- [ ] Mediate disagreements without taking sides
- [ ] Use decision frameworks for technical disputes
- [ ] De-escalate heated situations in the moment
- [ ] Apply disagree-and-commit effectively
- [ ] Prevent recurring conflict with clear expectations

---

## Time Estimate

- **Reading**: 60-80 minutes
- **Exercises**: 3-4 hours
- **Mastery**: Practice conflict resolution over 8-12 weeks

---

## Chapter 1: Recognize Early Signals

Sarah asks you to watch for early warning signs before a conflict becomes personal.

```markdown
## Early Warning Signs

Meetings:
- People talking over each other
- Repeated arguments with no progress
- Visible disengagement

Code review:
- Terse comments
- Rejected PRs without explanation
- Personal tone

Chat:
- Passive-aggressive messages
- Public call-outs
- Side conversations forming
```

## Chapter 2: Separate and Listen

Marcus suggests separate conversations first to understand perspectives without escalation.

```markdown
## 1:1 Mediation Prompts

- "I noticed tension around X. Help me understand your view."
- "What do you need to feel heard?"
- "What outcome would feel fair to you?"
```

## Chapter 3: Facilitate the Joint Conversation

Once you have context, bring both sides together and focus on interests, not positions.

```markdown
## Interests vs Positions

Position: "We must use Redux"
Interest: "I need predictable state management"

Position: "Redux is overbearing"
Interest: "I want simple code"
```

## Chapter 4: Use a Decision Framework

Sarah wants objective criteria to break ties. Marcus recommends a clear scoring method.

```markdown
## Technical Decision Framework

1. Define the problem and constraints
2. Define decision criteria (performance, complexity, team skill)
3. Evaluate options against criteria
4. Decide and document
5. Commit and revisit after results
```

## Chapter 5: De-escalate in the Moment

When things heat up, slow the conversation down and reframe the problem.

```markdown
## De-escalation Tactics

- Take a short break
- Lower your voice and slow down
- Summarize their position accurately
- Reframe from "you vs me" to "us vs the problem"
```

## Chapter 6: Disagree and Commit

Sometimes full agreement is impossible. You still need unity after the decision.

```markdown
## Disagree and Commit

"We debated this thoroughly. I have decided we will use Option A
because it best fits the criteria. I know you preferred B and your
concerns are valid. Can I count on your support moving forward?"
```

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Taking sides too fast** - You lose trust before you gain clarity.
2. **Ignoring emotions** - Feelings drive behavior, even in technical debates.
3. **No decision path** - Debates repeat if criteria are missing.
4. **Skipping follow-up** - Agreements fade without check-ins.

## Practice Exercises

1. Role-play mediating a technical disagreement
2. Create a decision framework for a recurring conflict
3. Draft a de-escalation script for a heated meeting

### Solutions

<details>
<summary>Exercise 1: Mediation Plan</summary>

```markdown
1. Meet with each person separately
2. Identify shared goals
3. Run a joint session focused on criteria
4. Document the decision and follow up in 2 weeks
```

**Key points:**
- Listen first, then align.
- Keep the focus on the problem.
- Follow up to ensure commitment.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Exercise 2: Decision Framework</summary>

```markdown
Criteria: Performance, complexity, team expertise, timeline
Score each option 1-5, then discuss gaps and trade-offs
```

**Key points:**
- Use shared criteria to reduce bias.
- Document the rationale.
- Revisit if outcomes change.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Exercise 3: De-escalation Script</summary>

```markdown
"I can see this is important to both of you. Let's take 5 minutes,
then come back and align on the criteria we care about most."
```

**Key points:**
- Pause the escalation.
- Reframe toward shared goals.
- Invite a calmer restart.
