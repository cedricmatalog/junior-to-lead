# Effective 1:1s

> **Last reviewed**: 2026-01-06


## Week 41: The Growth Engine

Two engineers feel stuck, and morale is dipping. Sarah asks you to use 1:1s to unblock growth and build trust. Marcus reminds you that the best 1:1s are not status meetings; they are coaching conversations. This week focuses on structure, questions, feedback, and the habits that make 1:1s a reliable growth tool.

## Mental Models

Before you dive in, here's how to think about the core concepts:

| Concept | Think of it as... |
|---------|-------------------|
| **1:1s** | Coaching sessions - focus on the person, not the project |
| **Feedback** | A mirror - show behavior and impact clearly |
| **Trust** | A bank account - consistency builds balance |
| **Growth plans** | A map - show the next steps and milestones |

Keep these in mind. They'll click as you build.

## Chapter 1: Define the Purpose

Sarah wants you to prioritize the human side of the work. Marcus reminds you that a good 1:1 solves for trust first, then growth.

```markdown
## 1:1 Priorities

1. Build relationship and trust
2. Support growth and development
3. Remove blockers
4. Align on priorities
5. Share context
```

## Chapter 2: Structure the Meeting

A consistent structure helps people feel safe and prepared.

```markdown
## Weekly 1:1 Template

1. Their items (15 min)
2. Growth and development (10 min)
3. Feedback (5 min)
4. Your items if time

Notes:
- Capture key points
- Track action items
```

```markdown
## Monthly Deep Dive

Happiness and engagement:
- How are you feeling about work (1-10)?
- What would make it a 10?

Growth:
- What did you learn this month?
- What do you want to learn next?

Career:
- Are you still excited about your path?
- How can I help your progression?
```

## Chapter 3: Ask Better Questions

Marcus suggests open-ended questions that invite reflection instead of yes or no.

```markdown
## Questions That Work

- What is the hardest part of your job right now?
- What do you need from me this week?
- What would success look like for you this quarter?
- What feedback do you have for me?
```

```markdown
## Questions to Avoid

- "Everything going okay?"
- "Is the project on track?"
- "Don't you think X is the right approach?"
```

## Chapter 4: Career and Promotion Conversations

Sarah asks you to be direct about expectations and evidence.

```markdown
## Career Conversation Guide

Understand aspirations:
- Where do you want to be in 2 years?
- What kind of work energizes you?

Assess current state:
- Where are you strongest?
- What gaps do you see?

Create a plan:
- One goal for this quarter
- Projects that build the skill
```

```markdown
## Promotion Conversation

"The Senior role expects X, Y, Z.
I see you doing X well. For Y, I need to see A and B.
Let's build a plan together and check progress monthly."
```

## Chapter 5: Deliver Feedback That Lands

Marcus recommends the SBI model for clarity.

```markdown
## SBI Example

Situation: "In yesterday's design review..."
Behavior: "...you interrupted the designer multiple times..."
Impact: "...it made it harder to understand their rationale."
Request: "In future reviews, hold questions to the end."
```

## Chapter 6: Build and Repair Trust

Consistency beats intensity. Show up, follow through, and be clear about commitments.

```markdown
## Trust Builders

- Do what you say you will do
- Admit mistakes quickly
- Protect confidentiality
- Advocate for growth opportunities
```

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Using 1:1s for status** - Status belongs in async updates.
2. **Skipping tough topics** - Avoidance erodes trust.
3. **Vague feedback** - Without specifics, behavior does not change.
4. **Inconsistent cadence** - Missed meetings signal low priority.

## Practice Exercises

1. Create a 1:1 template for your team
2. Practice the SBI model for recent feedback situations
3. Draft a quarterly growth plan for an engineer
