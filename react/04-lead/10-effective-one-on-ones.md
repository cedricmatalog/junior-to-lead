## The Purpose of 1:1s

### What 1:1s Are For

```markdown
## 1:1 Priorities (in order)

1. **Build relationship and trust**
   Their concerns, not yours

2. **Support their growth**
   Career development, learning

3. **Remove blockers**
   What's slowing them down?

   Make sure we're on same page

5. **Share context**
   What they need to know
```

- Project deep dives (separate meeting)
- Your venting session
- Surprise performance feedback

## Asking Good Questions

### Open-Ended Questions

```markdown
## Questions That Work

### To Understand State
- "How are you feeling about X?"
- "What's on your mind?"
- "What's the hardest part of your job right now?"

### To Dig Deeper
- "Tell me more about that."
- "What makes you say that?"
- "How did that make you feel?"

### To Encourage Reflection
- "What would you do differently?"
- "What did you learn from that?"
- "What would success look like?"

### To Understand Needs
- "What do you need from me?"
- "How can I help?"
- "What's blocking you?"
```

### Questions to Avoid

```markdown
## Questions That Don't Work

❌ "Everything going okay?" (Yes/no, surface level)
✅ "What's challenging you right now?"

❌ "Is that project on track?" (Status, not 1:1 material)
✅ "How are you feeling about the project?"

❌ "Don't you think X is the right approach?" (Leading)
✅ "What are you considering for approach?"
```

## Career Conversations

### Career Discussion Framework

```markdown
## Career Conversation Guide

### Understand Aspirations
- "Where do you see yourself in 2 years?"
- "What kind of work energizes you most?"
- "What skills do you want to develop?"

### Assess Current State
- "Where do you feel you're strongest?"
- "What gaps do you see in your skills?"
- "What experiences are you missing?"

### Create a Plan
- "What's one thing you could work on this quarter?"
- "What projects would help you grow in that area?"
- "How can I support your development?"

### Check Progress
- "How's progress on X goal?"
- "What's working? What isn't?"
- "Should we adjust the plan?"
```

### Promotion Conversations

```markdown
## Talking About Promotions

### When They Ask
"I want to be promoted to Senior. What do I need to do?"

**Good Response:**
"Let's break this down. The Senior role expects X, Y, Z.
I see you doing X well. For Y, here's what I'd want to see.
Let's create a plan to get you there."

### When They're Not Ready
"I think you're not ready yet for this reason.
Here's what I'd need to see: [specific examples]
Let's check in monthly on progress."

### When They're Ready
"I agree you're ready. Here's what needs to happen:
[process details]. I'll advocate for you in calibration.
The timeline is typically X."
```

## Giving Feedback

### SBI Model in Practice

```markdown
## Feedback Example

**Situation**: "In yesterday's design review..."

**Behavior**: "...you interrupted the designer multiple times
before they finished presenting their rationale."

**Impact**: "This made it harder for us to understand their
thinking, and I noticed they became less willing to share."

**Request**: "In future reviews, could you hold questions
until the end of their presentation?"
```

### Difficult Feedback

```markdown
## Delivering Hard Feedback

### Preparation
- Have specific examples
- Focus on behavior, not character
- Know what you want to change
- Consider their perspective

### The Conversation
1. State the behavior clearly
2. Explain the impact
3. Listen to their perspective
4. Agree on next steps
5. Express confidence

### Example
"I've noticed in the last few PRs, comments from reviewers
are being dismissed without consideration. [examples]

This is affecting team trust and code quality.

I'd like to understand your perspective. What's going on?"

[Listen]

"Going forward, I need to see more engagement with review
feedback. Can we agree on that? I'm confident you can do this."
```
